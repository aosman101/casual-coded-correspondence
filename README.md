# Casual Coded Correspondence

A hands-on cryptography notebook where you **decode and encode messages** using the **Caesar** and **VigenÃ¨re** ciphers. Includes a brute-force Caesar solver and punctuation/spacing preservation so examples stay readable.

> Built as a single Jupyter Notebook for easy, copy-pasteable experimentation.

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s inside

- **Caesar cipher tools**
  - Decode/encode with a chosen shift (0â€“25).
  - Try-all-shifts **brute-force** helper to solve unknown shifts.
- **VigenÃ¨re cipher tools**
  - Encode/decode using a repeating keyword.
- **Friendly UX**
  - Keeps spaces and punctuation intact.
  - Clear, step-by-step cells you can run top-to-bottom.

> The Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a fixed offset, using modulo 26 (which is a classic monoalphabetic substitution). The VigenÃ¨re cipher, on the other hand, applies a series of Caesar shifts that are derived from a repeatedly used keyword, representing a simple polyalphabetic substitution.
