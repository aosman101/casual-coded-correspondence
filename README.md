# Casual Coded Correspondence

A hands-on cryptography notebook where you **decode and encode messages** using the **Caesar** and **VigenÃ¨re** ciphers. Includes a brute-force Caesar solver and punctuation/spacing preservation so examples stay readable.

> Built as a single Jupyter Notebook for easy, copy-pasteable experimentation.

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s inside

- **Caesar cipher tools**
  - Decode/encode with a chosen shift (0â€“25).
  - Try-all-shifts **brute-force** helper to solve unknown shifts.
- **VigenÃ¨re cipher tools**
  - Encode/decode using a repeating keyword.
- **Friendly UX**
  - Keeps spaces and punctuation intact.
  - Clear, step-by-step cells you can run top-to-bottom.

> The Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a fixed offset, using modulo 26. This method is a classic example of monoalphabetic substitution. In contrast, the VigenÃ¨re cipher employs a series of Caesar shifts based on a keyword that is repeated throughout the text. This represents a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
